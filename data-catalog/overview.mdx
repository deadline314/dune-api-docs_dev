Dune provides a repository of blockchain data across a range of networks. Our tables are designed to deliver detailed analytics suitable for developers, traders, and researchers.
All of our data tables are accessible through the Dune [Web App](/web-app/overview), the [Dune API](api-reference/overview/introduction) or the [Snowflake Data Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZSVZMYSCO/Dune). 

## Our Data Difference

We are building world-class data infrastructure so you don't have to. Our data catalog is designed to provide the most comprehensive and accurate blockchain data available. We are committed to delivering the highest quality data, with the following features:

- **Rapid Refresh Rates:** Data from blockchain networks is updated almost instantaneously, typically within two minutes.
- **Comprehensive Chain Histories:** Full access to blockchain data histories without gaps, ensuring source integrity.
- **Accurate and Validated Data:** Commitment to accuracy, with validated consistency and uniqueness for all transactions and events.
- **Rich Data Variety:** Decoded data transforms complex byte arrays into clear, structured, and usable information.
- **Curated Data:** Dune's [Spellbook](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook) enables collaborative, community driven data modelling, unlocking new insights at lightning speed.
- **Vibrant Community Data Pools:** Access to vast pools of data contributed by an active and innovative community.
- **Cross-Chain:** Our entire data catalog is hosted in the same database, making it easy to compare and contrast data across different chains.
